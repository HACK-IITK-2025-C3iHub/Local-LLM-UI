POLICY IMPROVEMENT ROADMAP
==========================
Policy: {policy_type}
Framework: NIST Cybersecurity Framework

PHASE 1: IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (0-3 months)
Priority: Critical gaps requiring immediate attention
- Action 1: [Specific action]
  - NIST Function: [Identify/Protect/Detect/Respond/Recover]
  - Resources Required: [People, tools, budget]
  - Success Criteria: [Measurable outcome]
  
- Action 2: [Specific action]
  ...

PHASE 2: SHORT-TERM IMPROVEMENTS (3-6 months)
Priority: Significant gaps and process enhancements
- Action 1: [Specific action]
  ...

PHASE 3: LONG-TERM ENHANCEMENTS (6-12 months)
Priority: Minor gaps and optimization
- Action 1: [Specific action]
  ...

NIST FRAMEWORK ALIGNMENT
- Identify (ID): [Specific improvements]
- Protect (PR): [Specific improvements]
- Detect (DE): [Specific improvements]
- Respond (RS): [Specific improvements]
- Recover (RC): [Specific improvements]

KEY MILESTONES
- Month 1: [Milestone]
- Month 3: [Milestone]
- Month 6: [Milestone]
- Month 12: [Milestone]

RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS
- Personnel: [Roles needed]
- Technology: [Tools/systems needed]
- Budget: [Estimated costs]
- Training: [Training requirements]
